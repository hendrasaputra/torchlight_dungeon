# Torchlight Dungeons: plan

A full-size dungeon crawler after Moria (Robert Koeneke, 1983; C port Umoria). It covers everything Moria has:
races and classes, the town and its shops, deep dungeon levels, about 280 kinds of monster, hundreds of items,
magic and prayers, hunger, identification, and save games.

The game is turn-based on a grid, like Moria. The engine's job is light: a torch in the dark, lit rooms, glowing
monsters, and spell flashes. Physics is the finishing touch, after each turn: rubble, shattering potions, blasts
that shove debris.

The plan runs in ten phases. Phase 1 is the small "Moria-lite" recommended earlier, and it ships to the cartridge
shelf on its own. Each later phase adds one Moria system and ships as an update, so the game is playable at every
step.

## Where this lives

Phases 0 to 7 were built inside the ASCII BaseCommander arcade (github.com/hendrasaputra/asciibasecommander), as
one of its cartridges. In October 2026, after phase 7, the game moved to its own repository and domain. The history
here keeps the commits that touched the game. Read the older phases' notes with that in mind: "the shelf", the
shared Settings page, `core.js` and `menu.js` belong to the arcade. Since the move, the game has its own Detail
setting in its menu, and `src/lib.js` holds the few arcade helpers it still uses (preferences, high scores, the
resize watcher and the frame loop).

## Progress

| Phase | State |
|---|---|
| 0 Groundwork | Done. Field of view, light, the scheduler and levels have node checks in `tests/torch.js`. Light lives in `fov.js` next to field of view, instead of its own `light.js`. Not yet: the "-more-" prompt (long turns show their newest lines, and the full log is under Messages). |
| 1 First descent | Done. On the shelf as an early version: a human fighter, 15 monsters to 500 ft and a little beyond, 16 item kinds, food and light fuel, running and resting, high scores. A playing bot ran thousands of turns without errors. Not checked yet: a full game on a real phone. |
| 2 Races, classes and stats | Done. 8 original peoples and 6 callings, rolled or point-bought stats, 8 skills, infravision, class titles, hit dice and experience penalties; checks for all 48 pairs. Pulled forward so every class plays differently now: each caster's first power (Spark, Mend) with mana and failure chances, a Delver's ambush, a Lampwarden's brighter light, and throwing with direction or nearest-target aiming (from phases 3 and 5). A bot playing each class reached about 225 ft as an Arcanist and 370 ft as a Sellsword or Oathknight. |
| 3 Items and identification | Done. 196 original item kinds (not yet the 300 planned: spell books and digging tools arrive with phases 5 and 8), 23 special kinds and 6 artifacts, 12 equipment slots, weight and burden, bows and ammo, wands, staffs and rods, sticky curses, per-character flavours, learning by use, Identify, and sensing {magical} / {cursed} on pickup and over time. Items you have seen stay on the map. Pulled forward: one set of effect handlers for every item (the base for phase 5's spells), and the first timed effects (speed, heroism, blessing, resistances, poison, confusion, blindness, sleep) from phase 8. Checks: 60,000 items over six depths, flavours, names before and after identifying, and knowledge surviving a JSON round trip. Every kind was used, worn and inspected in the browser without errors. |
| 4 The town | Done. Lanternhollow, a walled town with six shops (General Store, Armoury, Weaponsmith, Temple, Alchemist, Magic Shop), each with a keeper, a markup and staples that never run out; stock changes between visits; buying teaches you an item's kind, and selling makes the keeper tell you what it is. Day and night: by day the sun crosses the sky and buildings cast shadows that move; at night there is faint moonlight and the lamp posts and shop doorways glow. Townspeople, including a cutpurse who steals gold and runs. Word of Recall between the town and your deepest level; level 1 has stairs up; a new character starts in town with gold to spend. Prices are fixed: haggling (open question 1) is left out for now, and there is no home to store things in yet. Checks: 100 towns all reachable, shop goods never cursed or worthless, prices and Charisma, restocking. |
| 5 Magic and prayers | Done. Two realms of 30 original spells in four books each (spells.js); the Arcanist and Lampwarden learn their whole realm by level 40, while the Delver, Wayfinder and Oathknight are part-time casters who start later and learn part of it. Study (S) when you have the book and the level: arcane casters choose, holy casters are granted a prayer at random. Casting needs the book in your pack, costs mana, and can fail by level and stat; spells grow with your level, and the first casting of each gives experience. New effects: recharging, Send Away, Ward of Elements, Sense Evil, Tend the Flame, Turn the Dead and Dispel Evil, Shield from Evil, Banish Evil, Unbroken Flame, earthquakes that break walls into physics rubble, and Unravel; holy light burns the undead. Books 1 and 2 are sold in town. Checks: realm sizes, books, levels, failure, studying, and that every spell's effect exists; all 60 were cast in the browser without errors. Not met: the "reach 1,000 ft" playtest. The test bots, which do not flee or shop, die around 200 to 450 ft, so that needs a person to play it. Not done: cone-shaped spells and making doors (monster breath comes with phase 7). |
| 6 The new look | Done. The character view is gone: every tile, figure and icon is drawn by code into small pixel canvases (`sprites.js`), with five depth themes and a timber-and-roof town; the light field is laid over them softly (`render.js`); the hero is a paper doll of what you wear; monsters have body plans, with a seeded shape for any kind without one. Moves slide, attacks lunge, hits flash, damage numbers float, and debris bounces off the walls (own particles instead of the engine's world). The interface is HTML (`ui.js`): HUD with status, minimap, target and messages; the A, S, D, W action bar and hotbar; the Character, Pack, Book, Journal and Map tabs (P hides the panel); item cards with comparisons and quality colours; dialogs for items, spells, shops, the menu and help; title, creation and tombstone screens. Keyboard only, with the modern keys by default and the Classic and roguelike sets in the menu. Checks: a bot ran 6,000 mixed actions (moving, every smart key, hotbar, tabs, dialogs, shops, 24 level changes) with no errors, and every monster, item, spell, doll and depth theme was drawn. Not checked yet: a long game played by a person. |
| 7 The full bestiary | Done. `bestiary.js` holds 267 original kinds in 50 families, from cave rats to dragons, each family in tiers by depth, with hit dice, armour, damage and experience worked out from depth (the first fifteen kinds keep their phase 1 numbers). There are 25 named uniques, each with set depths and good drops and appearing once a game, and the final boss, Morrowgloom the Lantern-Eater, at 2,500 ft; killing it wins the game and the dungeon goes on. Behaviour: packs, erratic movement, fear, breeders (capped), invisibility (True Sight potion, helms of Seeing), passing through walls, tunnelling into rubble, mimics that look like treasure, stealing gold and items (dropped again when the thief dies), and draining experience (losing levels), stats, wand charges, food and light. Blows can poison, confuse, blind, paralyse (Free Action stops it), terrify (no melee) and deal elemental damage, which resistances cut to a third. Monster spells: blink, teleport, teleport-to, heal, haste, blind, confuse, scare, slow, paralyse, darkness, drain mana, missiles, bolts, balls and summons, using the phase 5 bolt and ball drawing; breath is a fan of five coloured rays. New body plans in `sprites.js`; big monsters are drawn larger. Monster recall is kept across characters (localStorage), learned by sighting, being hit, seeing spells, resistances and kills, and shown in the Journal and the target card. Checks: a validator in `tests/torch.js` (blows, spells, resistances, body plans, depth coverage, uniques, names), and `tests/balance.js`, which fights every kind with every class at the expected level and passes for every band. A bot ran 10,000 steps over 50 levels without errors, and the boss, mimics and theft were tried directly. Not yet: monsters that fight each other, and a person playing to the boss. |

## Ground rules

### Licence

Umoria is GPL-3.0, and this project is MIT, so nothing may be copied from it:

- not its C code, nor code translated from it;
- not its data tables (monsters, items, spells, shops), names, descriptions or numbers;
- not anything from Tolkien: no Balrog, mithril, hobbits, Morgoth, or Tolkien's named characters.

Game systems are not protected, so we keep the systems and write all the content ourselves:

- races, classes, light radius, hunger, flavour identification, spell books, shops, and dungeon depth;
- original monsters, items, spells, races and classes, names, numbers and formulas.

We work from general knowledge of how Moria plays, not from its source. Each data file says that it is original.

### What stays like Moria

- Turn-based play on a grid, with a speed system: fast monsters act more often.
- Each trip down the stairs makes a new level, and levels are not kept. This also keeps save files small.
- Permanent death: the save is deleted when the character dies, and a tombstone goes in the hall of fame.
- A town on the surface; the dungeon below gets deeper and harder.
- A final boss deep down, with an original design.

### What the engine adds

| Moria | Torchlight Dungeons |
|---|---|
| A light radius of 1 or 2 squares, on or off | A real light field: a warm flickering torch that fades with distance, lanterns, lit rooms, and coloured light from glowing monsters and spells. Walls block light. |
| Day and night in town | The sun's angle and colour over the town; at night, only lamps |
| Spells print a message | Bolts and balls leave a trail of light, flash the walls around them, and shove debris |
| Rubble is a map symbol | Digging and earthquakes break walls into rubble that bounces and settles, then becomes passable floor |
| Monsters vanish when killed | Each kill bursts into a few tumbling bits in the monster's colour |
| Potions are quaffed | Thrown potions shatter into glass that skitters across the floor |

Physics only runs between turns, as a short animation (under 0.4 s) that any key skips. It never decides the
outcome of a turn, so the turn-based rules stay exact.

## Size of the content

| Content | Target | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Races | 8 | Original peoples, each with stat changes, infravision, skills and an XP penalty |
| Classes | 6 | Fighter, arcane caster, holy caster, rogue, ranger and holy knight, each with its own name and title per level |
| Character levels | 40 | |
| Dungeon | 50 levels, then deeper with no limit | Shown as depth in feet, like Moria |
| Monsters | about 280 | About 40 families in tiers, plus about 25 named uniques and the final boss |
| Item kinds | about 300 | Weapons, armour, launchers and ammo, light sources, food, potions, scrolls, wands, staffs, rings, amulets, books |
| Special items | about 20 kinds, plus a handful of one-off artifacts | For example "of Slaying", "of Resistance" |
| Spells | 2 realms, about 30 each, in 4 books per realm | Arcane and holy |
| Traps | about 15 | |
| Shops | 6 | General store, armoury, weaponsmith, temple, alchemist, magic shop |

Estimated size: 12,000 to 18,000 lines of JavaScript and data. The page stays self-contained, at about 1.5 MB or less
with sound.

## Architecture

All the code is in `src/`. `build.sh` joins it into `index.html`, one self-contained page. (Before the move it was
`src/torch/`, built into the arcade's `torchlight-dungeons.html` after its `core.js` and `menu.js`.)

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `head.html` | Page markup: the map canvas, the HUD, the side panel and dialogs (phase 6: keyboard only, no gamepad) |
| `data/*.js` | The tables of races, classes, monsters, items, specials, spells, traps, shops and flavours. Plain data; each file checks itself |
| `rng.js` | Seeded random numbers, so a game can be replayed and tested |
| `gen.js` | Dungeon and town generation |
| `fov.js` | Field of view, by recursive shadowcasting |
| `light.js` | The light field: coloured light from several sources, blocked by walls |
| `turn.js` | The energy and speed scheduler |
| `combat.js` | To-hit, damage dice, armour, criticals, saving throws |
| `monsters.js` | Monster AI and spawning |
| `items.js` | Item generation, identification, inventory and weight |
| `magic.js` | Spell and effect handlers: bolts, balls, beams, detection, teleport and more |
| `town.js` | Shops, stock, prices and day/night |
| `save.js` | Saving, versioning and migration |
| `ui/*.js` | The map view, message log, inventory, character sheet, shop and spell screens, and the command menu |
| `game.js` | The main loop and input |

The map is 198 × 66 cells, like Moria. The screen shows a part of it that scrolls with the player: about 100 × 36
cells on a desktop, and fewer on a phone. The rest of the screen holds the status bar and the message log. All UI
text is drawn on `TEXT_LAYER`, so it stays readable in pixel mode.

## Re-analysis: the new look (October 2026)

The rules are in good shape after phase 5, but the game still looks like a 1983 terminal: one character per cell,
letters for monsters, and every screen is a text list. The new goal is a web RPG that people want to play. It
keeps the top-down grid, the turn-based exploration and all of Moria's depth, and it looks and handles like a modern
RPG: you see your character and the gear they wear, the items are pictures, and there are panels, tooltips and a
hotbar. This changes how the game is drawn and controlled, not its rules.

### What stays, and what is replaced

| Part | Lines today | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| Rules: `rng`, `fov`, `turn`, `gen`, `data`, `items`, `shops`, `chars`, `spells` | about 830 | Unchanged. Every node check still applies. |
| `game.js`: actions, effects, monsters, the turn loop | about 900 | Kept. It stops calling `say` and the list screens directly and raises events (`hit`, `moved`, `died`, `opened`), so the new view can animate them. |
| `game.js`: drawing (map, status bar, title, creation, tombstone) | about 200 | Replaced by `render.js` |
| `game.js`: list screens (commands, inventory, equipment, inspect, character, shop, spells, help) and input | about 350 | Replaced by `ui.js` (HTML panels) and a new input layer |

Torchlight stops drawing with the ASCII `Screen` and `menu.js`. It keeps `core.js` for the physics debris (kills,
rubble and glass, now drawn as pixels) and `arcade.js` for preferences, scores, the pad and the loop. It would be
the first cartridge that is not drawn in characters, which suits it: the others are arcade games, and this one is
an RPG.

### How it looks

Everything is drawn by code when the page loads, into small offscreen canvases. There are no sprite sheets and no
image files, so the page stays one self-contained file. The prototype (`_proto/proto.html`) shows all of it working
on a real generated level.

- **Tiles:**
  - 16 × 16 logical pixels, drawn at a whole-number zoom (2×, 3× or 4×), with smoothing off so the edges stay crisp.
    The Detail setting picks the zoom.
  - A three-quarter top-down view, as in the tileset references. A wall above a floor shows its brick face with a
    lighter cap; other walls show their dark tops. Choosing the tile from its neighbours (autotiling) gives proper
    corners.
  - Each cell has a fixed seed, so floors vary (flagstones, cracks, grit) but don't change from frame to frame.
  - Doors, open doors and stairs each have their own tile.
- **Depth themes:** a palette and floor pattern for each band of about ten levels: worked stone, mossy caves, crypts,
  magma, and crystal. The town has cobbles, grass, timber houses with roofs, lamp posts and shop signs.
- **Light:** the existing light field is drawn over the tiles, one pixel per cell, smoothly enlarged and multiplied
  in, with a little warm bloom on top.
  - What you see now is lit by the real torch and room colours.
  - Places you remember are cold, dim blue.
  - Places you have never seen are black.
  - Bolts and flashes light up the walls as they pass. This is the engine's light, but much softer and nicer than
    lighting each character.
- **The player is a paper doll** drawn from what they wear: the body shape by people (short Burrowfolk, huge
  Cragborn), then hair or helm, armour by material (cloth, leather, mail with a dither, shining plate), cloak,
  gloves, boots, the weapon by type (blade length, axe, mace, polearm) and the shield by size. Each piece of gear
  you change shows on the map and on the character sheet.
- **Monsters:**
  - One generator per body plan: rodent, canine, worm, winged insect, spider, beetle, bear, mould, wisp, plus the
    paper doll for humanoids (goblins with tusks, skeletons, trolls).
  - Size, colour and features come from the monster's own data.
  - Any kind without a plan gets a mirrored shape seeded by its id, so every one of the roughly 280 kinds in phase 7
    looks like itself, with no art to draw.
- **Item icons:** one drawing per category, coloured by material or flavour. An unknown potion is just "a Violet
  potion" until you learn what it is, so identification still works with pictures.
- **Rarity:** a coloured frame and name, using the qualities the game already rolls:
  - cursed is red, plain is white, good is blue, special kinds are purple, and artifacts are gold;
  - grey until sensed or identified.
- **Animation is visual only and never changes the rules:**
  - moves slide over about 90 ms, attacks lunge, and whatever is hit flashes;
  - damage numbers float up, and health bars show over hurt monsters;
  - idle figures bob slightly, the torch flickers, and kills burst into physics debris;
  - any key skips it.

### How it plays

The interface is HTML on top of the canvas: crisp text at any size, scrolling, hover tooltips, screen readers, and
much less code than drawing panels by hand.

- **Layout:** the map on the left and a tabbed side panel on the right, as in the character-sheet references.
  - **Character:** level, name, people, calling and title; experience, health and mana bars; the paper doll with its
    12 equipment slots around it; stats, skills, resistances and speed.
  - **Pack:** a grid of icons, a weight bar, and sorting.
  - **Spells:** the pages of your books: each spell's icon, level, mana, failure chance and effect, studying, and
    dragging a spell onto the hotbar.
  - **Journal:** the message log, what you know about each monster, and the item kinds you have identified.
  - **Map:** the whole level as you remember it.
- **HUD on the map:**
  - a small always-on minimap, because the view drops from about 100 × 36 cells to about 30 × 18 at 3×;
  - the depth, the light's fuel, hunger, and status icons with turns left;
  - a target frame with the monster's health and a one-line description;
  - a fading message log;
  - a hotbar for potions, scrolls, wands and spells (keys 1 to 0).
- **Tooltips** show an item card: its icon, name, damage or armour, bonuses, weight and description. They also
  compare it with what you wear now, in green or red, as in the tooltip reference.
- **Shops:** the shop's stock and your pack side by side. Click or drag to buy and sell, and the price is in the
  tooltip.
- **Character creation:** the people and calling are pickers with the paper doll changing as you choose.

**Controls: keyboard only.** There is no touch gamepad and no phone layout for this game, and the mouse only
points at things: hovering shows tooltips, and clicking works in the panels and dialogs. The right hand moves and
the left hand does the four most common things, and each of those keys decides for itself so that a fight rarely
needs a menu.

| Key | Does |
|---|---|
| Arrow keys | Move one step. Moving into a monster attacks it, and moving into a door opens it. |
| Two arrows together | Move diagonally. The game waits about 60 ms for a second arrow. Home, End, PgUp, PgDn and the numpad also move diagonally. |
| Shift + arrow | Run until something interesting happens |
| **A** Attack | Attack the target: swing if it's next to you; otherwise fire your launcher if you have ammo, or throw darts. With no target, attack the nearest monster in sight. |
| **S** Spell | Cast the readied spell, at the target if the spell needs aiming |
| **D** Drink | Drink the healing potion that best fits your wounds. With none, a holy caster prays a healing prayer. At full health it does nothing and says "You are not hurt". |
| **W** Grab | Pick up what's here, take the stairs, or enter a shop. If there's nothing to do, it says so and takes no turn. |
| Q | Ready the next spell. Shift+Q readies the one before. |
| E | Eat the plainest food |
| R | Rest until healed, or until something disturbs you |
| F | Refill your lantern, or swap in a fresh torch |
| Tab | Target the next visible monster. Shift+Tab goes back. |
| Space | Wait one turn |
| 1 to 0 | Use the hotbar slot (a potion, scroll, wand or spell) |
| I, C, B, J, M | Pack, Character, spell Book, Journal and Map tabs. Pressing a tab key again leaves the panel. |
| P | Show or hide the side panel |
| L | Look at the target, or at everything in sight |
| Esc | Close the dialog, or open the menu |

Inside a dialog or a panel tab, the arrow keys move the selection, Enter chooses, and Esc goes back. Moria's own
letter keys stay available as the "Classic keys" option, together with the roguelike set, and that option turns
the scheme above off.

**Decisions:**
- the character (ASCII) view is dropped entirely;
- on a wide screen the side panel is always open, as in the references, and P hides it;
- the game is keyboard only.

### Why do this before the bestiary

Phase 7 adds about 270 monsters. With this look, each monster needs a body plan and colours, which is one field in
its data. Doing the look first means every monster is written once, for the final view. Doing it after would mean
going back over all 280.

### Cost

About L: roughly 2,000 to 2,500 new lines (`render.js`, `sprites.js`, `ui.js`, a new `head.html`), and about 550
lines leave `game.js`. The page grows by under 100 KB. Speed: tiles are drawn once each and copied, and the light
overlay is one small image per frame, which the prototype draws easily at 60 frames a second.

## Phases

Phase sizes: S is about the work of one of the existing games, M is two to three times that, and L is more.

### Phase 0: groundwork (M)

The pieces every later phase builds on.

- The scrolling map view, and a test map you can walk around.
- Field of view and the light field. Each square is lit, remembered (seen before and drawn dim), or unknown.
- The torch flickers and lights the walls, and light fades with distance.
- The turn scheduler, with speed and energy.
- Seeded random numbers, and the message log, with "-more-" when messages pile up.
- Input:
  - two key sets: original keys and roguelike (hjkl) keys;
  - an 8-way D-pad on touch;
  - a command menu (for pick up, drink, read, cast and so on), built on the pause menu in `src/menu.js`.
- Node tests: field of view is symmetric, light is blocked by walls, and the scheduler is fair across speeds.

**Done when:** you can walk a test map with a flickering torch, at 60 frames a second on a mid-range phone.

### Phase 1: first descent, the Moria-lite (M)

The first version on the shelf. It is the small game recommended earlier, built on the Phase 0 foundation so
nothing is thrown away.

- **Dungeon generator:**
  - rooms (plain, lit and dark, and a few special shapes) joined by corridors;
  - doors, and stairs up and down;
  - a check that every level is fully connected.
- **Characters:** one race and one class (a human fighter), with hit points, experience and levels.
- **Fighting:** melee with damage dice, armour class, and to-hit rolls.
- **Monsters:** about 15 original kinds, from depth 50 ft to 500 ft. They hunt, flee, and come in packs.
- **Items:** weapons, armour, food, torches, oil flasks, and healing potions. Everything is already identified.
- **Light and food:** the torch burns down and you buy or find new ones. A simple food counter.
- **Death and scores:** a tombstone, and high scores for depth and experience.
- **Physics:** kills burst into bits.

**Done when:** a new player can play a full 20-minute game from the stairs down to death, on keyboard and touch.

### Phase 2: races, classes and stats (M)

- Eight original races and six original classes, each with stat changes, skills and an XP penalty.
- Six stats, rolled or bought with points, and a character sheet.
- Experience up to level 40, a title per level for each class, and hit dice.
- Skills: fighting, shooting, saving throws, stealth, disarming, magic devices, searching and noticing.
- Infravision: seeing warm-blooded monsters in the dark, drawn as a faint red glow in the light field.

**Done when:** each class plays clearly differently in the first 500 ft.

### Phase 3: items and identification (L)

- **Equipment:** weapon, bow, two rings, amulet, light source, body armour, cloak, shield, helmet, gloves and
  boots.
- **Item generation:** about 300 kinds, scaled by depth. Items roll to-hit, damage and armour bonuses, with good
  and bad (cursed) rolls.
- **Specials:** about 20 special kinds, and a few original one-off artifacts.
- **Identification, Moria-style:**
  - each new character gets its own shuffled flavours: potion colours, scroll titles, wand woods, ring stones;
  - an item becomes known by using it, by a scroll or spell, or by selling it;
  - shops show "{magical}" or "{cursed}" when the item has been sensed.
- **Weight:** carrying too much slows you down.
- **Shooting and devices:** launchers and ammo, plus wands, staffs and rods with charges.
- **Physics:** a thrown potion shatters into glass bits.

**Done when:** a node test generates 10,000 items at each depth band, every one valid, and the identification
state survives a save and load.

### Phase 4: the town (M)

- A surface level with six shops, and townspeople who are mostly harmless and sometimes thieves.
- Day and night:
  - by day the sun lights the town from a slowly moving angle;
  - at night only lamps glow, and shop windows show warm light.
- **Shops:**
  - stock is chosen per shop and refreshed while you are in the dungeon;
  - each shop has a keeper with greed and personality;
  - you can buy and sell.
- Stairs between the town and the first level, and a Word-of-Recall-style item that takes you between the town
  and your deepest level.

Haggling (Moria has it) is an option and off by default. See the open questions.

**Done when:** a trip down and back to buy gear is smooth on touch.

### Phase 5: magic and prayers (L)

- **Two realms, about 30 spells each, in four books per realm:**
  - arcane, for the caster, rogue and ranger;
  - holy, for the priest and holy knight.
- **Learning:** spells unlock by level and from books. Each spell has a mana cost and a failure chance that depends
  on the caster's stat.
- **Effects** are one set of handlers, shared with wands, staffs, scrolls and monster spells:
  - bolt, beam, ball and cone;
  - detection, light and darkness;
  - teleport and teleport-to;
  - heal and cure, bless, resistances, slowing and confusing;
  - earthquake, and making or destroying doors and walls.
- **Engine use:**
  - a ball spell's blast shoves debris and flashes light on the walls;
  - Light Room really lights the room in the light field;
  - Darkness takes the light away;
  - earthquakes turn walls into rubble.

**Done when:** every spell has a node test of its effect, and a playtest of each realm reaches 1,000 ft.

### Phase 6: the new look (L)

The re-analysis above, built in this order so the game stays playable at every step:

1. **`render.js` and `sprites.js`:**
   - the tiles, the depth themes and the town;
   - the light overlay;
   - the paper doll, the monster body plans and the item icons;
   - the move, attack and hit animations, and debris as pixels.

   This replaces `drawMap`, and the old text screens still work on top.
2. **The input layer:**
   - arrows and diagonals, the A, S, D and W actions, and Tab targeting;
   - hotbar keys;
   - the Classic and roguelike key sets.
3. **`ui.js` panels:**
   - the HUD, the minimap, the message log and the hotbar;
   - the Character and Pack tabs with tooltips and comparisons, then Spells, Journal and Map;
   - shops, character creation, the title screen and the tombstone.

   The old list screens are deleted as each panel replaces them.

**Done when:**
- every command in phase 5 can be reached from the keyboard;
- no text list screens are left;
- every item, monster and gear combination draws without errors (a bot run over all kinds);
- it runs at 60 frames a second on a mid-range laptop.

### Phase 7: the full bestiary (L)

- A monster data format:
  - character and colour, depth, rarity, speed, and hit dice;
  - armour class, up to four attacks with hit effects, and behaviour flags;
  - spells and breath, what it drops, and its own light, if any.
- About 40 families, each in tiers by depth. Families include vermin, insects, jellies and moulds, snakes, canines,
  goblin-kin, undead, giants, elementals, demons and dragons, all with original names and descriptions. Together
  they come to about 280 kinds.
- **Behaviour:**
  - packs and wandering;
  - erratic movement;
  - fear and fleeing;
  - breeders that multiply;
  - invisibility;
  - passing through walls;
  - stealing and draining.
- Monster spells and breath use the Phase 5 effects. A breath is a cone of coloured light.
- About 25 named uniques with set depths and drops, and the final boss deep below, with an original design.
- **Monster recall:** what you know about each kind, learned by meeting and fighting it.
- **Balance:** a node script that simulates fights for each class and depth band, to catch monsters that are far too
  weak or too strong.

**Done when:** the data validator passes, monster recall works, and no depth band has a monster the
simulation rates as unwinnable at the expected character level.

### Phase 8: survival and dungeon detail (M)

- **Hunger:** full, hungry, weak, fainting, starving. Food kinds differ in how much they feed you.
- **Light:** torches and oil burn down; lanterns are refilled with oil flasks.
- **Status effects:** poison, cuts, stun, blindness, confusion, fear, paralysis, hallucination, and slow and fast.
- **Traps:** about 15 kinds, including trapdoors, pits, darts, summoning runes, teleport, and fire and acid. They are
  found by searching or noticing, and can be disarmed.
- **Doors:** secret doors, and doors that are locked, stuck or jammed. Spikes jam a door shut.
- **Digging:** tunnelling through rubble, magma and quartz veins, with treasure in the veins. Broken rock becomes
  physics rubble.
- **Repeat commands:** resting, running along corridors, and repeated commands.
- **Level feelings.**

**Done when:** a long playtest has no soft-locks, meaning no state where the player cannot act, and none where a
level has no way out.

### Phase 9: save games (M)

- **When it saves:** on every level change, every few hundred turns, when you leave the page or switch tabs, and on
  quit.
- **Slots:** one character per slot, and three slots.
- **Permanent death:** the slot is cleared on death, and the tombstone and character dump go to the hall of fame.
- **Format:** versioned JSON, with a migration step for each version. Because levels are not kept, a save holds
  the character, inventory, flavours, shops, the current level, and the turn count. The target is under 200 KB.
- **Storage:**
  - localStorage, with a clear message when it is full or blocked;
  - export to a file and import from a file, for backups and moving to another device.
- **A text character dump**, like Moria's.
- Node tests: save, load, save again gives the same file; old-version saves still load; a damaged save is refused
  with a message instead of crashing.

### Phase 10: presentation and polish (M)

- **Sound:** `audio/torch-sfx.py`, in the style of the other games:
  - footsteps, hits and misses;
  - a sound for each spell element;
  - monster cries by family;
  - doors and shop bells;
  - town and dungeon ambience;
  - an original music loop for the town, and one for the depths.
- **Help:** an in-game command reference and help screen.
- **Options:** key sets, auto-pickup, "-more-" prompts, haggling, colour-blind-safe status colours, and larger text.
- **Balance:** a full pass from the town to the final boss.
- **The page:** cover art (prompt in `cartridges/PROMPT.md`), a site icon of its own, and the README.

## Testing throughout

Every phase leaves node checks next to `tests/physics.js`:

- level connectivity;
- field-of-view symmetry;
- combat expected values;
- data table validation;
- item generation;
- spell effects;
- save round-trips;
- the balance simulation.

Browser tests use the same temporary test-page method as the other games.

## Risks

| Risk | How we deal with it |
|---|---|
| Writing 280 monsters and 300 items is a lot of content | Family templates with tiers, a validator, and a balance simulation. Drafts are generated in bulk and then edited by hand. |
| Copying Moria by accident | Content is written from scratch, never from Umoria's tables. A review step checks names and descriptions against the Tolkien and Moria lists before each release. |
| Too many commands | The four smart action keys (A, S, D, W), a hotbar, and context actions: moving into a door opens it. |
| Corrupted or lost saves | Versioned saves, migrations, export to a file, and refusing bad data with a message |
| Page size and speed on phones | Data stays as compact tables; light is only recomputed when something changes; physics only runs between turns. |
| Long project | Every phase ships something playable, so stopping after any phase still leaves a good game. |

## Open questions

1. **Haggling:** keep Moria's haggling as an option (proposed: off by default), or leave it out?
2. **Keys:** offer both original and roguelike (hjkl) key sets (proposed), or only one?
3. **Save slots:** three (proposed) or one?
4. **Endgame:** a final boss at a set depth, then an endless dungeon (proposed)? Or end the game when the boss
   falls?
5. **Kept levels:** keep Moria's new level on every trip down the stairs (proposed), or remember levels?
